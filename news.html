                            The Destiny Islands are a beautiful paradise where children's laughter abounds. Day after day, Sora, Riku, and Kairi talk and dream of new places, new worlds beyond their islands. They ponder the usual questions that adolescents do - about the world outside, about their own existence.
                            Little do they know a great destiny awaits them. One stormy night, a terrible darkness invades Destiny Islands. Thus does their journey begin... Sora awakens in another world in a place called Traverse Town.
